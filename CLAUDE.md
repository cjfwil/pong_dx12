# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a DirectX 12 graphics project using SDL3 for windowing and ImGui for UI. The project demonstrates modern DX12 rendering with triple buffering, constant buffers, and HLSL shaders.

## Build Commands

### Debug Build (VS Code default)
Uses the VS Code task configuration to build with debug symbols:
```bash
# The default VS Code task builds with /Zi /MDd for debug
# Press Ctrl+Shift+B in VS Code, or run:
cl.exe /D_DEBUG /Zi /EHsc /Wall /external:W0 /nologo /MDd /Isrc /Isrc/generated /Fe:main.exe main.cpp
```
Note: Include paths `/Isrc` and `/Isrc/generated` required for headers.

### Release Build
Use the Python build script:
```bash
python build.py
```

This creates an optimized executable in the `release/` folder and copies:
- Compiled executable
- SDL3.dll
- shader_source/ folder with HLSL shaders

### Line Count Statistics
```bash
python loc.py --verbose
```

## Architecture

### Code Organization

- **main.cpp**: Entry point, SDL initialization, main render loop, ImGui integration
- **src/renderer_dx12.h**: Complete DirectX 12 rendering pipeline (700+ lines)
  - Pipeline state, command objects, synchronization primitives
  - Resource creation and management
  - Contains `LoadPipeline()` and `LoadAssets()` functions
- **src/local_error.h**: Error handling utilities for HRESULT, SDL errors
- **shader_source/shaders.hlsl**: Vertex and pixel shaders
- **src/generated/OnDestroy_generated.cpp**: Auto-generated cleanup code (see Meta-Programming below)

### Global State Structures

The rendering system uses several global struct instances defined in `src/renderer_dx12.h`:

- **pipeline_dx12**: Core DX12 pipeline objects (device, command queue, swap chain, multiple pipeline states for MSAA, root signature, command list/allocators, descriptor heaps, MSAA render targets)
- **graphics_resources**: Per-frame constant buffers, vertex buffer, texture resources
- **sync_state**: Frame synchronization (fence, fence values, fence event, frame index)
- **msaa_state**: MSAA configuration (enabled flag, current sample count/index, supported levels, CalcSupportedMSAALevels helper)
- **viewport_state**: Window dimensions and aspect ratio
- **g_FrameCount**: Set to 3 for triple buffering

### Key DirectX 12 Patterns

#### Triple Buffering
The project uses triple buffering (`g_FrameCount = 3`) for all per-frame resources:
- Render targets (back buffers)
- Command allocators
- Constant buffers
- Fence values for synchronization

#### Synchronization Flow
1. **MoveToNextFrame()**: Signals fence, gets next back buffer index, waits if frame not ready
2. **WaitForGpu()**: Forces CPU to wait for all GPU work to complete
3. Each frame has its own fence value to track GPU completion

#### Resource Lifecycle
1. **LoadPipeline()**: Creates device, command queue, swap chain, descriptor heaps, depth buffer
2. **LoadAssets()**: Creates root signature, pipeline state, shaders, vertex/constant buffers, textures
3. **OnDestroy()**: Releases resources in dependency order (see Meta-Programming section)

#### Descriptor Heaps
- **m_rtvHeap**: Render target views (one per frame)
- **m_msaaRtvHeap**: MSAA render target views (when MSAA enabled)
- **m_dsvHeap**: Depth stencil view (single depth buffer)
- **m_mainHeap**: CBV/SRV heap for constant buffers and texture (shader-visible)
- **m_imguiHeap**: Separate heap for ImGui rendering

#### MSAA Support
Project supports 1x, 2x, 4x, 8x multisample anti-aliasing:
- **pipeline_dx12.m_pipelineStates[4]**: Array of PSOs, one per MSAA level
- **msaa_state.CalcSupportedMSAALevels()**: Queries device for supported sample counts
- When MSAA enabled, renders to MSAA targets then resolves to back buffer
- ResetCommandObjects() selects appropriate PSO based on current MSAA setting

#### Command Recording Pattern
Each frame in `PopulateCommandList()`:
1. Reset command allocator and command list
2. Set root signature and descriptor heaps
3. Bind per-frame constant buffer (indexed by frame)
4. Transition back buffer to render target state
5. Clear render target and depth buffer
6. Draw geometry
7. Render ImGui
8. Transition back buffer to present state
9. Close command list

### Meta-Programming for Resource Cleanup

**Important**: The `OnDestroy()` function is automatically generated by `meta_ondestroy.py`.

#### How It Works
1. `meta_ondestroy.py` parses `src/renderer_dx12.h`
2. Extracts all COM pointer declarations (ID3D12*, IDXGI*)
3. Determines correct cleanup order based on D3D12 dependency rules
4. Generates `src/generated/OnDestroy_generated.cpp` with proper Release() calls
5. main.cpp includes this file with fallback if generation fails

#### When to Regenerate
Run `python meta_ondestroy.py` whenever you:
- Add new D3D12 resources to pipeline_dx12, graphics_resources, or sync_state structs
- Change resource names
- Add new per-frame resource arrays

#### Cleanup Order
Resources are released in this priority order:
1. Sync objects (fence)
2. Constant buffers (with Unmap calls)
3. Graphics resources (textures, buffers, depth buffer)
4. Pipeline objects (command list, pipeline state, root signature)
5. Per-frame resources (render targets, command allocators)
6. Descriptor heaps
7. Swap chain
8. Command queue
9. Device (last)

**Never manually modify** `src/generated/OnDestroy_generated.cpp` - your changes will be overwritten.

## Known Issues

### Window Mode Switching Hang (Bug #1)
**When**: Introduced during window mode switching and swap chain recreation development (06/02/2026)
**Symptoms**: Static hang (no crash/assert) when switching window modes. Visual transition completes but program becomes unresponsive - triangle stops moving, ImGui frozen, Alt+F4 unresponsive.
**Timing dependency**: If <5 seconds between switches or since program start, hang occurs. Waiting 5+ seconds between switches works fine.
**Reproduce**: Switch to window mode rapidly.

See bugs.md for full bug tracking.

## Shader Compilation

Shaders are compiled at runtime from `shader_source/shaders.hlsl`:
- Vertex shader entry point: `VSMain` (vs_5_0)
- Pixel shader entry point: `PSMain` (ps_5_0)
- Debug builds use `/D3DCOMPILE_DEBUG | D3DCOMPILE_SKIP_OPTIMIZATION`
- Release builds compile without debug flags

The shader file must be present in the working directory when running the executable.

## ImGui Integration

ImGui uses a custom descriptor allocator (`g_imguiHeap` struct in main.cpp) that:
- Manages a pool of 10 descriptor slots
- Provides allocation/free callbacks to ImGui backend
- Uses separate descriptor heap from main rendering

## Dependencies

All dependencies are linked via pragma comment directives in main.cpp:
- SDL3.lib
- d3d12.lib, dxgi.lib, d3dcompiler.lib, dxcompiler.lib, dxguid.lib
- imgui.lib

SDL3.dll must be available at runtime (copied by build.py for release builds).

## Debugging

- Error handling uses custom `HRAssert()` macro that logs HRESULT errors and breaks into debugger on debug builds
- All errors logged via SDL_Log
- Window title shows performance metrics (FPS, frame time)

## Instructions to Claude

Answer all questions concisely. Sacrifice grammar as much as you can get away with, so we can get our outputs as quickly readable as possible.
