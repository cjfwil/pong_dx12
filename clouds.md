## cloud system
this is designed for a low poly style, where we are not in a flying game or fast moving, or day/night cycle(?).this all assumes that we are at ground level or sea level.
- ultra distant low altitude clouds: a cylinder with no top or bottom, showing texture of faraway low-altitude clouds (side view)
- ultra high altitude clouds: inverted sphere which shows light wipsy texture (cirrus)
- cumulonimbus: large sprite or 3d model shape, which remains far away, or just a full skysphere texture
- overcast: skysphere texture only - no need for cloud layers because we can only see the lowest layer and cant see through it fron underneath
