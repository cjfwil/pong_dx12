### Exclusive Fullscreen and window resolutions
This engine will NOT support exclusive fullscreen. To support users who want to run at a different resolution to their monitor there will be an internal scaler option stretching from 50% to 200%.
In windowed mode there will be a drop down list of common resolutions in the supported aspect ratios (4:3, 16:9, 21:9).
Borderless will always display at the resolution of the desktop.
